  Productivity Tracker

This productivity tracker works when we enter
%s then
the total hours spent doing productive things
the total hours spent doing non productive things
the total hours spent doing neutral things

In addition, you have to also add your goal for the week/day
in the corresponding .txt file

This code then calculates and compares your goal to
your total productivity hours and prints if you made progress
toward your goal or if you exceed your goal
